# workshop-md-converter

Cloudflare Worker that converts Workshop.code wiki JSON into stable, agent-friendly Markdown for API consumers.

## Overview

This service provides Markdown-first wiki access with predictable routes and content negotiation.

## Available Endpoints

- `GET /` (Markdown onboarding guide)
- `GET /healthz`
- `GET /manifest.json` (machine-readable document manifest)
- `GET /wiki/categories.md`
- `GET /wiki/categories/:slug.md`
- `GET /wiki/articles.md`
- `GET /wiki/articles/:slug.md`
- `GET /wiki/articles/:slug` with `Accept: text/markdown`

## Quick Usage

```bash
# Root onboarding guide
curl https://md.wrightkit.dev/

# Machine-readable document manifest (JSON, metadata only)
curl https://md.wrightkit.dev/manifest.json

# Article index as markdown
curl https://md.wrightkit.dev/wiki/articles.md

# Workshop documentation category index
curl https://md.wrightkit.dev/wiki/categories/actions.md

# Workshop documentation category index
curl https://md.owbastion.codes/wiki/categories/actions.md

# Explicit markdown route
curl https://md.wrightkit.dev/wiki/articles/hero-color-reference-table.md

# Content negotiation route
curl https://md.wrightkit.dev/wiki/articles/hero-color-reference-table \
  -H 'Accept: text/markdown'
```

## Output Behavior

- Responses are served as Markdown (`text/markdown; charset=utf-8`) on markdown routes and markdown-negotiated article routes.
- Article routes first try `/wiki/articles/:slug.json`; only on 404 they fall back to `/wiki/articles.json`. Index rendering remains list-only.
- Article output includes YAML front matter with core metadata, including a `content_hash` (SHA-256 of the rendered document) for provenance and change detection.
- `GET /manifest.json` returns a compact, metadata-only document list (schema version, deterministic slug ordering, markdown/source URLs, conservative aliases). It never includes article bodies or content hashes; exact hashes come from the article route.
- Body conversion uses minimal cleaning only.
- Existing markdown structures (such as headings, code blocks, tables, and lists) are preserved.
- `<style>` and `<script>` tags are removed.
- Missing articles return Markdown 404 pages.
- Upstream fetch failures return Markdown error pages.

## Revision & Conditional Requests

- Article and manifest `ETag` values are content-derived: articles use the SHA-256 hash of the rendered document, so unchanged content keeps a stable ETag regardless of Worker version.
- Conditional requests are honored: a matching `If-None-Match` (or `If-Modified-Since` where `Last-Modified` applies) returns `304 Not Modified` with an empty body.

## Caching

- Generated Markdown (article index and article routes) is cached with the Workers Cache API. Cache keys include the route and renderer version, writes use `ctx.waitUntil()`, and hit/miss is observable via the `x-cache-status` response header (`HIT`/`MISS`). The manifest shares the same generated-content cache (JSON variant).
- Upstream Workshop.codes JSON subrequests are cached separately: success for `UPSTREAM_CACHE_TTL_SECONDS` (default 60s), 404 for 60s, and 5xx never. `x-upstream-cache` (`HIT`/`MISS`) reports upstream cache state at generation time.
- 404 responses use a short TTL; 406 and 5xx responses are `no-store` and never cached.
- The Cache API is PoP-local: entries live in the data center that served the request and are not a durable global store.
- Generation stays on demand and bounded: the article index and manifest are metadata-only; no bulk rendering or hashing of article bodies is performed. See `docs/ADR-002-caching-strategy.md` for the full strategy.

## Agent / Machine Consumers

The service exposes a small, stable machine surface for coding agents. The full contract — schema, slug rules, revision/hash semantics, caching and conditional-request behavior, error handling, and compatibility guarantees — is defined in `docs/MACHINE-CONSUMER-CONTRACT.md`. The backend is model/harness-neutral: it performs no search, ranking, or embeddings; consumers implement retrieval locally against the manifest.

Minimal flow:

```bash
# 1. Discover documents via the manifest (metadata only, no article bodies)
curl -s https://md.wrightkit.dev/manifest.json | jq '.documents[0]'

# 2. Fetch an exact document using its markdownUrl
curl -s https://md.wrightkit.dev/wiki/articles/hero-color-reference-table.md

# 3. Cache safely: the ETag is the content hash, so refetch conditionally
curl -s -D - -o /dev/null -H 'If-None-Match: "<etag from step 2>"' \
  https://md.wrightkit.dev/wiki/articles/hero-color-reference-table.md
# → 304 Not Modified while the document is unchanged
```

For local development and runtime configuration, use the repository scripts and `wrangler.jsonc` as the source of truth. This README is intentionally user-focused and omits internal deployment and CI details.
